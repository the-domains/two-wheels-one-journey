_Do not chase success, wealth or achievements - Go after that which makes you feel alive, and those things will **chase you**_

This begins with a simple background. I am a guy with a two wheels planning for a long journey. The prelude to that journey begins here at home, near Los Angeles. The first leg will be a 20,000 mile motorcycle journey from Alaska to Patagonia. Along the way I intend to engage with local health clinics to champion innovative approaches to healthcare delivery in the developing world. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a5d5b87f-6b1e-4c8a-bfe5-9a963a56cf50.jpg)
